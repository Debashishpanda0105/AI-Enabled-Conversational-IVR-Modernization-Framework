*Conversational IVR Modernization Framework*

Project Title

Conversational IVR Modernization Framework
________________________________________
🏢 Project Context
This project is developed under an Infosys Internship Program with the objective of modernizing legacy IVR systems built using VoiceXML (VXML) and integrating them with modern Conversational AI platforms such as ACS and BAP Service.
The goal is to enhance traditional IVR systems by enabling natural, voice-driven conversational workflows while minimizing redevelopment effort.
________________________________________
🎯 Project Statement
This project aims to modernize existing IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems built on VoiceXML (VXML) by integrating them with modern Conversational AI platforms such as ACS and BAP Service.
By reusing and extending legacy assets, the solution enables these systems to support conversational interfaces while minimizing rework. The approach focuses on:

•	Enhancing usability

•	Improving user experience

•	Reducing technical transition burden

•	Preserving existing IVR investments
________________________________________
 Expected Outcomes
 
•	✅ Integration of VXML-based IVR systems with Conversational AI platforms (ACS/BAP)

•	✅ Conversational interaction support within traditional IVR frameworks

•	✅ Minimal redevelopment effort during migration

•	✅ Enhanced end-user experience through voice-based workflows

 System Architecture Overview
 
🔹 Legacy Architecture

Caller → VXML IVR → DTMF-based Menu Navigation → Response

🔹 Modernized Architecture

Caller → Speech Input → Conversational AI (ACS/BAP) → Integration Layer → Legacy IVR Logic → Smart Voice Response
